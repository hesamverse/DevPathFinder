# DevPathFinder
🗺️ DevPathFinder Roadmap
🔰 Phase 1: MVP – A basic version to get started 🚀
📌 Goal: A simple form, get type and interest, and suggest a suitable learning path + scope.

Steps:
‌🎯 Define the domains precisely (e.g. backend, frontend, security, DevOps, Git, advertising, UI, database)

‌📝 Build a simple personality test (e.g. MBTI lite or a few key questions with A/B/C answers)

‌🧠 Initial recommender algorithm (simple conditional or dictionary to map types to domains)

‌📚 Design a database of paths (with JSON or simple dict: learning path + resources)

‌🖥️ Design a simple CLI or Web interface (e.g. streamlit for speed)

🧩 Phase 2: Deeper customization 🧠
📌 Goal: Turn the recommendation system into a powerful tool with mixed analytics

Steps:
‌🔗 Get input from GitHub or StackOverflow

Check the languages ​​used (with GitHub API)

Categorize by popularity and project phase

‌🧪 Combine personality test + interest in specific technology

Additional question: “To code” "Are you more interested in programming or design?" or "Which do you prefer, Rust or JavaScript?"

Add weight to domains based on interest and type

📦 Phase 3: Scheduling tools and user conditions 🛠
📌 Goal: Create a flexible learning path based on the individual's conditions

Steps:
‌🕓 Add a scheduling form (how many hours a day? How many days a week?)

‌🎯 User goal (job? freelance? personal project? just a hobby?)

‌📅 Generate a learning path table tailored to time and goal

🌍 Phase 4: Connect with communities and DAOs 🌐
📌 Goal: Suggest a community or DAO suitable for each individual

Steps:
‌📜 List of DAOs and their categories based on activity (DeFi, Security, Art, Infra,...)

‌🧠 Add DAO mapping to personality type + domain

‌📤 Show Discord / Twitter / DAO activity links for quick entry

🧠 Phase 5: NLP and user text analysis
📌 Goal: Understand the user from the descriptions they write

Steps:
‌📄 Add Open-text form like: “Tell me about your passion for programming”

‌🧠 Text analysis with TextBlob or ready-made model (like transformers) to extract keywords

‌🔀 Combine keywords with type analysis and provide a more personalized suggestion

🎖 Phase 6: Certificate and official output 🎓
📌 Goal: Provide shareable output, use on resume or social networks

Steps:
‌📄 Generate PDF file with learning path, type, scope, resources and schedule

‌🏅 Generate simple Badge or NFT (e.g. with python-pillow or API)

‌📤 Ability to save or email the output to the user

🧑‍💻 Phase 7: Intelligent chatbot / learning advisor

📌 Goal: Virtual advisor to suggest paths and resources

Steps:
‌💬 Create a simple bot with if/else logic or use OpenAI API

‌🧭 Answer the questions: “What should I read?”, “What should I learn after HTML?”

‌📲 Integration with Discord or Telegram or Web interface for live interaction

🤪 Phase 8: Fun and viral mode 🎁
📌 Goal: Fun part to attract and interact

Steps:
‌🤣 Design fun answers for types (“You’re an ENFP, make a half-hearted project and then you’ll get bored!”)

‌🃏 Ability to switch between “serious” and “joke” mode

‌🎮 Add Easter Eggs (secret answer or weird suggestion)
